= Elf, a CLI for Elfin

In the course of using link:https://github.com/11in/elfin[Elfin] you may encounter some tasks that you feel could be automated to save you time.
Fortunately there is a friendly elf here to...helf you.

If you find yourself needing a particular tool in the CLI, feel free to link:https://github.com/11in/elf/pulls[submit a PR] or a link:https://github.com/11in/elf/issues/new[feature request issue].

== Installation

While you can install this locally, by far the most useful install location is "global".

[source,bash]
----
$ npm i -g @11in/elf
----

== Usage

Once elf is installed globally, you can run it like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ elf
----

[WARNING]
====
Elf will only work if you run it in the root of an Elfin project.
